## Edukitchen: Cooking up new ideas in pedagogy

The crisis of the public university in India is well acknowledged, and in recent years we have seen the rise of the private university. Both however are aimed at the endless production of students, and what we sorely lack in India is an intellectual infrastruxture for post education life. We feel that Web 2.0 is perfectly placed to create virtual universities that rethink education, rethink the idea of tutors and students and offer the potential of creating rhizomatic open universities that will provide a new model for thinking of post education life.
		
## Who we are

We're students from the University of Michigan partnering with [Centre for Internet and Society](http://cis-india.org/).
